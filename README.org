#+title: Nix.el
 An Emacs interface to Nix
* Installation
This has only been tested on Emacs 27.1, so use with care.
** Dependencies
Obviously, you would need Nix. You would also need the following Emacs
packages, which can be downloaded from melpa.
- transient
- ivy (should be optional in the future, but hardcoded for now)
** Copy
Copy the =nix.el= file to your =~/.emacs=.
** Include
Either
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'nix)
#+end_src
or
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package nix)
#+end_src
* Usage
Call ~M-x nix-legacy~ or ~M-x nix~ for the newer nix flakes. 
* Goals
** Internals
- [ ] Custom for the completion framework
- [ ] Use ~start-process~ instead
- [ ] Custom for default flake
